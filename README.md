# Machine Learning Term Project

This repository contains a **separate term project** done for the course **Introduction to Machine Learning**. The course is **offered by the Data Science Master's program of University of Helsinki**.

Originally I completed the term project in March 2021 and this new repository contains the work that was done back then. The generated PDF report shows a more recent date since the PDF is generated from an already existing R Markdown file.
