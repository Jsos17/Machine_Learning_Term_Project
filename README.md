# Machine Learning Term Project

This repository contains a **separate term project** done for the course **Introduction to Machine Learning**. The course is **offered by the Data Science Master's program of University of Helsinki**.

In this term project I evaluated four different classifiers belonging to the classifier families **neural networks**, **generalized linear models**, **random forests** and **support vector machines** using four different data sets containing a two-class classification problem. The resulting report partially reproduces some of the analysis done in the paper [*Do We Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?][1] by Fernández-Delgado, M., Cernadas, E., Barro, S. and Amorim, D.

Originally I completed the term project in March 2021 and this new repository contains the work that was done back then. The generated PDF report shows a more recent date since the PDF is generated from an already existing R Markdown file.

The directory data contains files provided by the authors of the original article, and the directory Original\_paper\_results contains results that the original authors obtained for the classifiers and data sets that I used.
