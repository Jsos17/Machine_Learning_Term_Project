# Machine Learning Term Project

This repository contains a **separate term project** done for the course **Introduction to Machine Learning**, which is **offered by the Data Science Master's program of University of Helsinki**. In this term project I evaluated four different classifiers belonging to the classifier families **neural networks**, **generalized linear models**, **random forests** and **support vector machines** using four different data sets containing a two-class classification problem. The resulting report partially reproduces some of the analysis done in the paper *Do We Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?* [1].

Originally I completed the term project in March 2021 and this repository (created in July 2022) contains the work that was done back in March 2021. [The generated PDF report](https://github.com/Jsos17/Machine_Learning_Term_Project/blob/main/Separate_term_project_report.pdf) shows a more recent date since the PDF is generated from an already existing R Markdown file.

The directory *data* contains files provided by the authors of the original article, and the directory *Original\_paper\_results* contains results that the original authors obtained for the classifiers and data sets that I used.
